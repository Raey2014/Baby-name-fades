# Baby-name-fades

In this project, I analyzed the us-baby names over 100 years record by downloading from us social-security website. 
In this analysis, you will find (1) the most popular babies name for both boys and girls for the last ten years, 
(2) unisex names: names that are common for both boys or girls (3) fading names: appeared to be common for a few years and disappear/disappearing). 
Finally, we will predict the number of new baby names added every year by learning the number of new baby names from the past.
