# Baby name fades

In this project, I analyzed the us-baby names over 100 years record by downloading from us social-security website. 
## In this analysis, you will find 
* the most popular babies name for both boys and girls for the last ten years, 
* unisex names: names that are equally common for both boys or girls, 
* fading names: appeared to be common for a few years and disappeared/disappearing now,  
* Finally, we will predict the number of new baby name every year using **ARIMA**, a time series analysis method using autoregressive integrated moving average approach.
